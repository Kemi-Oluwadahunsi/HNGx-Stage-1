# HNGx-Stage-1
My first task in the HNG internship program was to create a simple bio-card using a data-testid Attribute.
Tools and Languages Used:
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT


ABOUT THIS PAGE:
According to the instructions given for this first task, this webpage is designed to show my Slack Username, Profile Picture, Current day and Current Time (as of the time of opening), and a clickable link to this repository on GitHub.
HTML was used for the frame, while CSS was used for the simple styling. Javascript was used to get the current date and time and also display them on the DOM. The time keeps working according to different time zones, so also the day.

MY BEST PART:
The colors used match the colors in the profile picture, which makes the page blend well.

LESSON LEARNT:
What I learned from this project is the ability to be creative, came up with this design within a few minutes, and it became more real as I got into it. I will say that I enjoyed working on this.
